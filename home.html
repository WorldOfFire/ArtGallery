                fashion – idealized figures of beautiful women surrounded by
                bouquets of flowers and leaves, symbols, and arabesques.

                A French painter and founder of Impressionism painting who is
                seen as a key precursor to modernism, especially in his attempts
                to paint nature as he perceived it. During his long career, he
                was the most consistent and prolific practitioner of
                Impressionism's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions of
                nature, especially as applied to plein air (outdoor) landscape
                painting. The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of
                his painting Impression.

                An Italian polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a
                painter, draughtsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor,
                and architect. While his fame initially rested on his
                achievements as a painter, he has also become known for his
                notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of
                subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography,
                painting, and palaeontology. Leonardo is widely regarded to have
                been a genius who epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal.

                years of his life. Van Gogh's work was only beginning to gain
                critical attention before he died from a self-inflicted gunshot
                at age 37. During his lifetime, only one of Van Gogh's
